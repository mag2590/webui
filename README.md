Freeseer Web UI project

This software would allow you to create html page with live video stream, IRC 
Channel and etherpad through command line interface. 

Dependencies and Libraries:

The webUI Generator consists of two parts:

1)  A commandLine tool 

2)	A Template Editor

For the commandLine tool, we have the following classes: 

cmlControl.py

config.py

event.py

httpTemplate.py

parsecsv.py

validurl.py

External libraries:

The httpTemplate.py class depends on the external library Jinja 2. Download and install the Jinja 2 version compatible with python 2.7
For the Template Editor, we have a separate detailed README inside the Editor section.

Configuration details:

In order to run the Command Line Tool run the cmlControl.py class.  There are two ways to run this class:

1)	Manual Mode

2)	CSV mode

1)Manual Mode:
This will prompt you to enter the URL for YouTube video or live stream, the Etherpad and IRC channel.
Based on the Command Line inputs, it generates a corresponding HTML Template using the Jinja 2 framework based template generator.

2)CSV Mode:

For this mode, we have created two test CSV files.  However, user can create his/her own CSV file and pass it as argument to the cmlControl.py class, along with the corresponding command.

Example usage:

-i test.csv

Where, -i is the first argument (args[0]) which stands for  input CSV file.

test.csv is the second argument (args[1]), which is the name of the CSV file.
